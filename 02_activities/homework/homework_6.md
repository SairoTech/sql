**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

        I have not worked in the tech field for a long time. The tech industry is changing rapidly, but issues related to ethics and inequality are still very prominent. In my personal experience, when applying for jobs at certain large companies, I have often wondered why factors like ethnicity or gender seem to matter. As a job seeker, I am not sure how this impacts the selection process for interviews, but it doesn't feel appropriate. It is necessary to build systems that are fair and equal for everyone.
          
        As I aim to re-enter the tech industry, I plan to consider how technology impacts people from different backgrounds, especially in diverse countries like Canada. When testing applications, it is crucial to thoroughly and rigorously test them, keeping in mind all possible scenarios, especially those related to ethnicity, color, and other forms of diversity. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the algorithms and systems I work on are free from bias and do not discriminate against any group. From the discussions we had in class, I realize how important it is to handle data, especially sensitive information, responsibly. Protecting users' privacy and getting their consent is essential.
        
        Another key area is accessibility. Technology should be designed to meet the needs of everyone, including people with disabilities. I would make sure that the tools and platforms I help create are inclusive and accessible. By collaborating with diverse teams and staying informed about ethical standards and regulations, I will hold myself accountable to deliver fair, responsible, and impactful solutions.
My goal is to work on projects that bring positive change and minimize harm to society, ensuring that technology is both fair and beneficial to everyone. Technology has the potential to be used for good or harm, and it is up to individuals like us to ensure that we utilize it in ways that benefit everyone.
